**Notes:**
* Transmit and Recieve pairs on M.2 Symbols are from the perspective of module not the host.
* Transmit and Recieve pairs on PCIe symbols are from the perspective of the host not the module. This will be changed in the future.
* Triple check the pinout on your specific M.2 socket to ensure correct wiring.
